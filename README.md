# Wi-Fi Password Extractor

This Wi-Fi extractor is made for extracting saved wifi passwords from windows computer in just one click.

A Wi-Fi password extractor can be useful in situations where you have forgotten the password to your own Wi-Fi network and need to recover it. For example, if you have a new device that you want to connect to your Wi-Fi network but can’t remember the password, you can use a Wi-Fi password extractor to recover the password from a device that is already connected to the network.

A Wi-Fi password extractor could be useful for network administrators or IT professionals who need to recover the password for a Wi-Fi network in order to perform maintenance or troubleshooting. In this case, the Wi-Fi password extractor can help the administrator quickly recover the password without having to reset the entire network.

Another use case for a Wi-Fi password extractor could be for educational or research purposes. For example, a student or researcher studying network security may use a Wi-Fi password extractor to understand how Wi-Fi passwords are stored and recovered on different devices and operating systems. In this case, the Wi-Fi password extractor is used as a tool for learning and research, rather than for accessing a Wi-Fi network without permission.

# Note
It is important to note that using a Wi-Fi password extractor to access someone else’s Wi-Fi network without their permission is illegal and unethical.
